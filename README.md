# Screenshot URL Actor

This Actor serves as a practical demonstration of using an Input Schema. It takes a URL and screenshot configuration parameters as input and outputs a screenshot of the website into the Key-Value store.

## How It Works

### Input

The input should be a JSON object containing specifications for capturing the screenshot. Below are the parameters you can configure:

| Field                             | Type    | Description                                                           | Allowed Values                                                   |

| `url`                             | String  | URL of the website to capture                                         | Any valid URL string                                             |
| `waitUntil`                       | String  | Specifies when to take the screenshot based on page load state        | "load", "domcontentloaded", "networkidle2", "networkidle0"       |
| `delay`                           | Number  | Delay in milliseconds after `waitUntil` event before taking screenshot| 0 to 3,600,000                                                   |
| `viewportWidth`                   | Number  | Width of the viewport for the screenshot                              | 100 to 3840                                                      |
| `scrollToBottom`                  | Boolean | Whether to scroll to the bottom of the page before taking a screenshot| true, false                                                      |
| `delayAfterScrolling`             | Number  | Delay after scrolling to the bottom before taking the screenshot      | 0 to 3,600,000                                                   |
| `waitUntilNetworkIdleAfterScroll` | Boolean | Wait for network to become idle after scrolling before screenshot     | true, false                                                      |
| `waitUntilNetworkIdleAfterScrollTimeout` | Number | Max wait time for network idle after scrolling              | 1,000 to 3,600,000                                               |
